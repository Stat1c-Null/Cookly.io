# AI Innovation Hackathon 2024

## Prompt
**How can AI be leveraged to create intelligent systems that adapt to individual needs while supporting critical decision-making in complex, time-sensitive environments?**

## Project: Cookly.io

### Description
Cookly.io is an AI assistant designed to suggest meals based on photos of the userâ€™s fridge and pantry contents. The goal is to eliminate the hassle of meal planning while reducing food waste.

### **Key Benefits**
- **Market Need**: A significant portion of food waste is caused by poor planning and forgetfulness. Cookly.io addresses this, appealing to budget-conscious, eco-friendly, and health-aware consumers.
- **Technical Feasibility**: Image recognition AI services are readily available through cloud providers, making this solution achievable when paired with a recipe database.
- **Scalability**: The assistant could expand into additional features like dietary tracking, shopping suggestions, and customized recipes.

### **Challenges**
- **Competition**: Similar functionality is available in other AI platforms, like general-purpose GPT models.
- **Image Recognition Accuracy**: Correctly identifying all items, especially leftovers (e.g., pizza or pasta), may be challenging.
- **Recipe Integration**: Licensing recipe databases or developing a comprehensive one that can filter by diet restrictions and allergies is complex and may increase costs.

## Timeline (11/13/24 to 11/19/24)

- **Day 1-2**: Research and select an image recognition API and a recipe database; outline app architecture.
- **Day 3**: Develop a prototype to identify food items and suggest recipes based on database matching.
- **Day 4**: Test the prototype with sample images; gather preliminary feedback on accuracy and usability.
- **Day 5**: Refine the image recognition and recipe suggestion logic based on feedback.
- **Day 6**: Implement final adjustments and prepare a demo for the hackathon presentation.
- **Day 7**: Final testing and documentation.
